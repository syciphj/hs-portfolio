# Henri's portfolio

This portfolio was made with Sveltekit and Typescript. The idea was to build a static site that could be deployed to Github pages.

If for some reason you want to try and build the project, see below. 

## Running the project

Clone the repo and as usual install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install`), and start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
